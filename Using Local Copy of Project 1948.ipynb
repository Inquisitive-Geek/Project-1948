married anyways But was that the main reason of them not getting along or was it T Ono oni nisu slu ali baku i oni su se ipak uzeli ali jel to bio glavni to su se oni posva ali to su se Like they didn t listen to grandma and they got married regardless but was that the main reason they they fought Why did they INTERVIEWEE Pa tata je vi e bio priklonjen svojoj mami tako da je onda pod uticajem njenih pri a i dalje njenih pri a o njihovoj strani Well dad was more deferential to his mom and so he was under the influence of her stories and her further stories about their side T So when they got married grandmother continued with the like hatred And her dad was like her dad listened to his mom more than his wife so they INTERVIEWER And is your grandma Catholic INTERVIEWEE Yes INTERVIEWER Okay I m starting to understand a little bit more sorry if I seem a little slow Okay I understand And what about your grandpa Are they still married INTERVIEWEE On nije bio jel za dedu pita He wasn t is she asking about grandpa T Mhm INTERVIEWEE On nije bio bio je po strani ali je on rano umro tako da kad sam bila prvi razred osnovne on je umro Ali je on uvijek podr bio na maminoj strani zato su se deda i baka sva ali He wasn t he was on the sidelines but he died early so when I was in the first grade of primary school he died But he always supp was always on moms side that s why grandpa and grandma fought T Na strani tvoje mame jel On your moms side right INTERVIEWEE Jeste Yeah T At first he was like independent in the story INTERVIEWER Oh okay neutral just T Neutral yes And then he was at her moms side so the grandma and grandpa they fought a lot and then when she was the first grade of primary school he died INTERVIEWER So he died Just medical complications And first grade here is 14 T No 7 It s grammar school Actually primary school grammar schools generally represent secondary education INTERVIEWER Grammar school Okay T Sorry INTERVIEWER I get really confused everything is different for me to learn so if I ask lots of questions I m trying to understand Okay I think I understand a little bit more And did your parents talk to you about the war or your grandparents Cause you were born towards the end of the war T Jesu li pri ali s tobom o ratu Roditelji ili pita i za roditelje i za Did they talk about the war with you Your parents or she s asking about both your parents and INTERVIEWEE Pa ne ba vi e sam slu ala od drugih Not really I heard more from others T Not really she she listened about that around INTERVIEWEE Meni su moji pri ali kako su bili u te koj situaciji kad su mene dobili ali da ih to nije sprije avalo ni u emu i da su opet se izborili s tim My parents told me how they were in a difficult situation when they had me but that it didn t prevent them from anything and that they managed T There were difficulties in their lives when she was born btu they It was like nothing to them but then they like INTERVIEWER Recovered T Recovered sorry INTERVIEWEE Moja sestra i mama su same ivjele u ratu onda je do ao moj tata One su se vi e puta iselile i njima je bilo njih dvije su vi e dosta pre ivjele nego on My sister and mom lived alone in the war and then my dad came They had to move multiple times and it was they lived through a lot more than him T Oni su se poslije rata uzeli ili prije rata They got wed before or after the war INTERVIEWEE U ratu During the war T Aha Her mother and her sister were living alone during the war INTERVIEWER Oh they were They were all alone T Mhm And then during the war her mothe and her father got married not before and not after during the war And then she was born in 95 1995 INTERVIEWER So that was really brave for your parents to get married during the war T Da je bilo hrabro ono That it was like brave INTERVIEWER Because of the mixed marriage INTERVIEWEE Yes INTERVIEWER And with your fam families being T Da je bilo hrabro to su se uzeli ono tokom rata That it was brave that they got married like during the war INTERVIEWEE Oni nemaju papira nisu vjen ani po zakonu ali su se oni uzeli zna i zajedno su ivjeli Tu nema nikakvih papira da su bili vjen ani zna i vanbra no sam dijete They don t have any paperwork they aren t wed by law but they were betrothed so they were living together There aren t any papers that they re married so I m an illegitimate child T Like they weren t because of the war they weren t like married by the law INTERVIEWER Oh T Not like INTERVIEWER Like official T Mhm INTERVIEWER They just kind of did their vows by themselves T Mhm INTERVIEWEE Yes INTERVIEWER Okay that works That s really funny That makes sense So then did your parents maybe think that by marrying from both sides that it would bring things together T Jesu li mislili ako e se ono vjen ati da su razli ite vjere da e to nekako uticati ono da e sklopiti njih zajedno Ono da e zato to su oni razli ite vjere da e to nekako uticati na ostatak ono da e pomiriti Naprimjer tvoja baka da e ako se uzmu da e ona biti okej s tim Did they think that if they like got married that their different faiths that they ll somehow influence like that it ll pull them closer together Like that they ll because they re of different religions somehow influence the rest like to reconcile For example your grandma that she ll if they got married that she d be okay with that INTERVIEWEE Iskreno ne znam o emu su tada razmi ljali tako da ne znam ta I honestly don t know what they were thinking of so I don t know what T She don t know what they were thinking so INTERVIEWER Yeah They didn t tell you INTERVIEWEE No never INTERVIEWER Okay that s really interesting Haven t heard a story like this one before And this is T Jel ti okej pri ati s tim preda mnom Are you okay to talk about this in front of me INTERVIEWEE INTERVIEWER And then this is your nephew what is his name INTERVIEWEE Harun T Harun INTERVIEWER And what s significant about this picture T ta je posebno za tu sliku Mo e re i kad je uslikana What s special about this picture You can say when it was taken INTERVIEWEE Ne znam kad je uslikana ima mo da dvije godine od toga I don t know when it was taken it s been two years maybe T Koliko on ima godina Ne to pri aj o njemu How old is he Talk about him INTERVIEWEE Izme u moje sestre i mene je razlike 14 godina i izme u mene i njega je razlika 14 godina i onda ja imam neki osje aj da se pona am prema njemu kao to se moja sestra pona ala prema meni The difference between me and my sister is 14 years and the difference between me and him is 14 years and so I have this particular feeling that I should treat him the way my sister treated me T So the age difference between her sister and her is 14 years and the age difference between her and her nephew is the same like 14 years And then she like has the feeling to INTERVIEWEE Kao starija sestra Like an older sister T To be like the older sister to him like her sister was to her INTERVIEWEE Ja sam uvijek bila tu po to moja mama ga je uvala i onda sam ja uvijek bila tu i dosta sam s njim provodila vremena zato sam dosta vezana I was always there since my mom babysat him and so I was always there and spent a lot of time with him that s why I m so attached to him T She INTERVIEWEE On je kao brat koji nisam dobila od svoje mame He s like the brother I didn t get from my mom T They have strong relationship because she was like a brother to her because jel tvoja sestra radila ono They have strong relationship because she was like a brother to her because did your sister like work INTERVIEWEE Mhm T Her sister worked a lot and then she and her mother they babys INTERVIEWER Babysit T Yeah INTERVIEWER The baby And so I guess I forgot to ask this question I have a lot of questions so I can fully understand When you re so your mom is representing one religion and your dad is representing another do you identify with either of those Or do you T Ono jel se ti nalazi u ijednoj od te dvije religije Like do you identify with either of those two religions INTERVIEWEE Ja sam kr tena zna i po katoli kom i la sam u crkvu i la sam u tu kolu ali se nikad nisam izja njavala kao katolik ili musliman po tujem obje vjere i slavim sve Zbog mame i zbog tate a ja se ne izja njavam I was baptized in the Catholic manner I went to church I went to a Catholic school but I never identified myself as a Catholic or Muslim I respect both religions and celebrate everything Because of my mom and dad but I don t identify with either T So when she was born she was like I don t know how you call this like INTERVIEWER Baptized I think she said In Catholic T Mhm mhm And when the baby is born in church they INTERVIEWER Yeah sprinkle T She was that and she went to church and went to that Catholic school but she she s not like How how was your question INTERVIEWER Do you identify with being T She doesn t identify herself like INTERVIEWER As Catholic T Or Muslim but she celebrates the holidays because of her mom and her dad INTERVIEWER So you just kind of go through the motions for mom and dad and you re not identifying with either Okay that makes sense to me I just had to clear it all up in my head here Okay and then my other question is if your nephew were to ask you about the war in the future what would you tell him T ta bi mu rekla za rat What would you tell him about the war INTERVIEWEE Rekla bi mu samo da ne bi valjalo da on pro ivi to I d just tell him that it wouldn t be good for him to live through that T She would say that she wouldn t like him to live through that INTERVIEWEE Da I rekla bi mu da ljudi nikad ne dijeli po vjeri nego samo po tom kakav je neko prema njemu Yeah And I d tell him not to distinguish people based on religion but based on how they treat him T And she would say that it doesn t matter what religion you are just how you behave to other people INTERVIEWER As a person That makes sense Would you tell your future children the same thing INTERVIEWEE Yes INTERVIEWER Yeah so it doesn t matter what religious identification you go with just the person that you are INTERVIEWEE Yes INTERVIEWER And when you think about what a good person is what are some of the qualities or characteristics you think about What is a good person INTERVIEWEE Osoba koja e te uvijek poku ati saslu ati A person who will always try to hear you out T Person that listens INTERVIEWEE Koja te ne e osu ivati zbog nekih stvari koja e te prihvatiti takvu kakva jesi Who won t judge because of certain things who ll accept you the way you are T Doesn t judge loves you the way you are INTERVIEWER That makes sense INTERVIEWEE Da te ne e osu ivati ne znam zbog vjere zbog seksualnog opredjeljenja nego ono kako se ja ili pona am prema tebi da li ti inim zlo ili ti inim dobro Who won t judge you I don t know because of your religion sexual preferences but like how I or behave towards you if I m being good or bad to you T Doesn t judge you for who are for religion for sexual INTERVIEWER Preference Orientation T Mhm Orientation just love you for who you are INTERVIEWER So sounds like someone that has more of an open mind and a broader persective on life T An open mind to je kad si ono sagleda svijet u ve em pogledu An open mind that s when you like look at the bigger picture INTERVIEWEE Jeste Yeah INTERVIEWER It s good to get perspectives of everyone because my definition of a good person can be totally different than yours so I have to ask cause I can t just assume as a researcher Oh I know what a good person is what do you think a good person is that s why I have to continue to ask questions What is this picture I know where that s at by the way you taught me how to say the other day T Ba ar ija Buh sh char shee yah INTERVIEWER Basta ija see I already forgot INTERVIEWEE Zna i poslije sestre i njenog sina ovo su mi mislim mama logi no i najbolja prijateljica s kojom ivim s kojom sam odrasla osnovna srednja fakultet So after my sister and her son these are my I mean mom obviously and best friend who I live with who I grew up with primary secondary school high school university T So this is her this is her mom and this is her best friend They grew up together they went to school together and now they live together INTERVIEWER Oh okay cool INTERVIEWEE Pored onih prijatelja koje sam navela na po etku ona slika ona se odvaja od njih zna i po svemu Besides the friends I listed in the beginning that other picture she s seperate from them like in everything T So besides the friends from the first picture she s different in every way INTERVIEWER How are you different in every way T Kako je Not she the best friend How is Not she the best friend INTERVIEWER Oh different in every way Like opposite T Opposite yes The participant does not say or imply this at any point during the conversation the translators confirmation of this is based on her own understandings of what is being said or asked INTERVIEWER So that s why you have such a good friendship T Zato imate dobre That s why you have a good INTERVIEWER Cause opposites attract Yeah And is he 19 as well T It s a she INTERVIEWER Oh she Sorry I didn t even notice T Koliko ona ima godina How old is she INTERVIEWEE Isto kao ja 20 Same as me 20 T That s her she s 20 INTERVIEWER And does she go to the faculty as well Or different INTERVIEWEE No T No politics INTERVIEWEE Politics INTERVIEWER Oh yeah I ve seen the buidling And then I wanted to mention in this picture you look so happy You re like more happy than everyone else T Ti izgleda najsretnije You look the happiest INTERVIEWEE Pa zato to je moj ro endan zato to je to bilo iznena enje za mene Well that s because it s my birthday because it was a surprise for me T Because it was her birthday and it was a surprise party INTERVIEWER Oh Those are always nice So how has your best friend influenced your life T Kako je ona uticala na tvoj ivot How did she influence your life INTERVIEWEE Ona je dosta uticala na moje odluke She influenced my decisions quite a lot T Haj dalje pa u onda prevesti Go on then I ll translate INTERVIEWEE Zna i na odluke kad bilo je to u svako doba dana i no i za razliku od njih Mislim vi e vi e poznaje moju mamu i sestru i nekako je vi e lan porodice So she influenced decisions when at any time of day or night unlike them I mean moreso she knows my mom and sister better and is somehow more of a part of the family T I nastavila je biti tvoja prijateljica And she continued being your friend INTERVIEWEE Da Yes T Kako bi rekla to za odluke She helped her to make decisions big decisions She was there when they weren t the How can I say the thing for decisions She helped her to make decisions big decisions She was there when they weren t the INTERVIEWER Parents T No the first friends INTERVIEWER Oh the first friends T Yes She s like a part of her family because she was always there and she knows her mom and her sister a lot INTERVIEWER Since she goes to the faculty of politics do you guys ever talk about the politics here in Bosnia INTERVIEWEE Pa ne ba ina e nemamo ba lijepo mi ljenje o tome Well not really we don t really have a good opinion about it T Not really she doesn t have a good picture of Bosnian politics politics in Bosnia INTERVIEWER Yeah So you don t have a good picture or your best friend doesn t have a good picture INTERVIEWEE Both of us INTERVIEWER Both So it s almost maybe a little overwhelming to know what s going on politically here in Bosnia Almost like too big to know Or T Previ e previ e znati o politici Too much knowing too much about politics INTERVIEWEE Ne razumijem I don t understand T Can you INTERVIEWER the question Yeah So when you re thinking about politics here in Bosnia it might be too much to even grasp It seems like it s really difficult to understand every aspect cause there s so many different forms of government I don t even understand I think I get more confused but I want to ask you guys what do you think about the politics here Do you dialogue and have conversation with people your age about it INTERVIEWEE Nemam ba lijepu sliku a ono vi e bi voljela da odem odavdje I don t really have a good picture and like I d prefer to leave here T She INTERVIEWEE Ne svi a mi se na in ivota ovdje I don t like the wat of life here T She doesn t like the way of living here in Bosnia And she would like to go from Bosnia to INTERVIEWER Where would you like to move INTERVIEWEE Bilo gdje samo ne ovdje Anywhere just not here T Wherever just not here INTERVIEWER And when you say you don t like where or how to how it is to live here what specific things do you not like Help me understand cause I don t live here Cause I don t know INTERVIEWEE Ka i da nemam dovoljno slobode ovdje i mislim da bi se negdje drugo mo da mogla vi e isticati dok ovdje ne Say that I don t have enough freedom here and I think that I could maybe stand out more somewhere else which I can t here T Kako se ka e sloboda Freedom Because of the freedom she thinks she we don t have enough freedom here to like raise our voice or something How do you say freedom Freedom Because of the freedom she thinks she we don t have enough freedom here to like raise our voice or something INTERVIEWER Yeah so T And she thinks when she move INTERVIEWEE Somewhere else T Somewhere else that she would like would have more freedom and INTERVIEWER Yeah what about what freedoms specifically would you want T ta je za tebe sloboda ono What is like freedom for you INTERVIEWEE Na in izra avanja na in ispoljavanja svojih emocija Ovdje dosta toga kad ne to ka es dosta osu ivano The manner in which one expresses themselves their emotions A lot things here when you say something it s judged a lot T So when you say something here lots of people judge you for your emotions for INTERVIEWEE Isto tako ako si ne to druga iji druga ije te i gledaju Also if you re kind of different they look at you differently as well T If you are different they look at you differently and she would like that to stop to like INTERVIEWEE Ako ima druga ije razmi ljanje od drugih isto tako te osu uju If you re way of thinking is different they also judge you T Mhm When you have a different opinion they judge you and yeah INTERVIEWER And I guess help me understand this I understand that Bosnia used to be a part of former Yugoslavia and that was a communist rule and so everything was together and not divided What do you think about that or what do you know about that or can you help me understand more about that T ta misli o Jugoslaviji i tome da je Bosna ono posebna Ono mo e re i bi li volila da Jugoslavija ponovo bude ili ne bi ili What do you think of Yugoslavia and of Bosnia being like special Like you can say if you d like it if Yugoslavia reunited or not or INTERVIEWEE Pa iz pri a svojih svog dede mislim da bi volila vi e da je onakvo vrijeme nego sad ovo I smatram da bi svako drugo vrijeme bilo bolje nego ovo poslije rata Well from the stories of my grandpa I think I d like that time better than what we have now And I think that any other time would be better than this one after the war T From stories from her grandad she would like to live in Yugoslavia not like independent Bosnia INTERVIEWER Yeah What happened what was so good about Yugoslavia before T ta je bilo bolje What was better INTERVIEWER What are some stories that he shared with you INTERVIEWEE Pa ba to to sam maloprije rekla imali su vi e na kraju su imali svoje sad je sve Well exactly as I said before they had more in the end each had his own now everything is T Like everyone was Jednaki kako bi to Everyone was like Like everyone was Equal how could I Everyone was like INTERVIEWEE Mo e re i You can say INTERVIEWER Together T Like together and they were not different like if you were if you are different religion I won t judge you and like everyone was INTERVIEWEE Ne bilo je i tad tog osu ivanja ali smatram da je bilo manje Poslije rata je to dosta to sve poraslo taj No there was judging back then as well but to a lesser degree I think After the war it increased that T That was the judging was before but she thinks when Bosnia was independent it was like more judging more problems INTERVIEWER More seperate T More issues between people INTERVIEWER Oh okay So before that it didn t really exist and then now it s more T It it existed but it wasn t like that big deal INTERVIEWER A big deal T Mhm INTERVIEWER Okay And now it s kind of a a big deal Okay I understand Has he shared any other stories about former Yugoslavia INTERVIEWEE No INTERVIEWER Just that it was together And it seemed to be very good INTERVIEWEE I ono to sam itala po internetu ali se dosta toga ne sje am mislim And what I read on the internet but I don t remember most of that I think T So she read about it on the internet but she like doesn t remember what specifically INTERVIEWER Yeah cause she was born at the end Bosnia was already T So she thinks maybe I wasn t clear because for example for example naprimjer she is not Muslim she is not Catholic people would judge her like Why Why are you not Muslim Why are you not Catholic INTERVIEWER Today T Yes and then INTERVIEWER But in former Yugoslavia doesn t matter T Mhm INTERVIEWER Got it I understand So it seems like religion is a very big deal here and there s 3 main religions T Mhm INTERVIEWER And you need to identify with one of those 3 T Jel se mora opredijeliti ili Do you have to choose or INTERVIEWER In order to be T Jel se mora opredijeliti da bude naprimjer Bo njak ne mora Do you have to choose to be for example Bosniak you don t INTERVIEWEE Pa dobro izbjegavam to gdje se tra i Well I avoid where it s expected T She kako se ka e izbjegavam When they ask her what religion she is she is like She how do you say avoid When they ask her what religion she is she is like INTERVIEWER I m not religious T Mhm But if you mean like do you have to be some religion to be a nationality No it s not like important INTERVIEWER So then the people that are asking you they Who are the people that are asking are they the older generations Or are they people your age Who who is the person in your mind that is the ones who are asking these questions INTERVIEWEE Stariji ljudi Older people T Older people INTERVIEWER Older people T Mhm INTERVIEWER So it s almost as if the older people don t give approval to the younger people if they are thinking more openly and they re not identifying with one of those 3 religions even though there s so many more or not any at all So it seems like there s a real disconnect between older and younger What about the give me an age here when you think of older adults do you think of 30 and up 35 and up 40 and up T Kad misli na starije koliko godina otprilike Vjerovatno ovi koji su pre ivjeli rat jer oni ba zbog toga When you think of older people how old approximately Probably the ones who lived through the war because that s why they INTERVIEWEE 40 50 i vi e 40 50 and more T 40 50 and more INTERVIEWER 40 50 and more okay That helps me understand So okay So if they re 40 and they live here they probably have been through former Yugoslavia or Yugoslavia T Mhm INTERVIEWER And then they ve been through Bosnia as an independent state T Mhm INTERVIEWER Okay T I mean the main reason is because their friends like their friends offended them in the war so INTERVIEWER Oh yeah So friends turned on friends and now it T And they are worried about our generation too like not happen the same INTERVIEWER Yeah So they re trying to keep you seperate T To keep us safe INTERVIEWER To keep you safe T Mhm Ono stariji Mhm Like the older INTERVIEWER So it s almost like they re trying to protect you in the only they know how T Mhm Jesi razumijela Ono da Mhm Did you understand Like INTERVIEWEE Mhm T Da nas poku avaju za titi That they re trying to protect us INTERVIEWER Do you feel protected when they re doing that Do you feel more connected when you are Does that make sense like do you feel more protected when you re only connected to someone that you have a lot of similar similarities with Or do you still feel connected with people different than yourself That s a complicated question it might take a while T Sad ja sam njoj rekla mo da je zbog toga to su se ono prijatelj na prijatelja okomio i oni nas ho e da za tite tako da ho e da nas odvajaju od drugih religija A ona je sad pitala je li jel se ti osje a za ti eno zbog toga to oni rade ili se osje a za ti eno ako si s nekim s kim ima istih osobina ili razli itih osobina I just told her that maybe it s because like friend turned on friend and they want to protect us by seperating us from other religions And she just asked if if you feel protected because of what they re doing or do you feel protected if you re with someone with who you share similar characteristics or different characteristics INTERVIEWEE S kim imam vi e istih osobina With whom I share more similar characteristics T She doesn t feel protected when they doing that and she feels protected with people that have similarities INTERVIEWEE I razumijem da ho e da za tite ali ja se ne sla em sa tim toliko jer rade u skroz pogre nom smjeru And I understand that they want to protect us but I don t agree with that so much because they re going about it in the wrong way T And she understands that they want to protect us but they are doing the wrong way they are doing it the wrong way INTERVIEWER Yeah what would be the right way of protecting INTERVIEWEE Da nas puste da se dru imo s kim ho emo To let us hang out with whoever we want T To leave the choice of friendship to us INTERVIEWER So letting you make your own decisions and kind of following your own intuitions in order to be protected T Mhm INTERVIEWER So does that disconnect you more or connect you more to the older person who s trying to protect you Do you feel more connected do you feel more disconnected Do you have any feelings towards that at all INTERVIEWEE Nemam osje aja nisam I don t have any feelings towards that I m not T Nothing INTERVIEWER You re just like It s just another 40 year old T Samo jo jedan etrdesetogodi njak Just another 40 year old INTERVIEWER And you re just like Another one T Mhm INTERVIEWER Okay I understand Who is in this picture INTERVIEWEE This INTERVIEWER Yeah T Gle kako si fina Look how nice you look INTERVIEWEE Hvala To mi je matura Thanks That s my prom T It s her prom INTERVIEWEE I ovo je moj pratioc na maturi And this is my date to prom T He was her INTERVIEWER Date T Date yeah To prom INTERVIEWEE Ne znam meni je matura bila ne to posebno s obzirom da sam zavr ila srednju i da sam taj dio ostavila iza sebe I don t know prom was something special for me considering that I finished high school and that I left that behind me T Her prom was something special to her because she finished high school and INTERVIEWER Okay So it s kind of a celebratory moment something to remember And did you guys go to the same school INTERVIEWEE Yes INTERVIEWER So that s why you guys know each other And this is in Zenica It s Zenica right And are you still friends with him INTERVIEWEE Pa ne ujemo se toliko esto zato to on ima obaveza on je fudbaler ina e Well we don t hear from each other that often because he has things to do he is a footballer T Ali ste prijatelji jo uvijek But you re still friends INTERVIEWEE Pa jesmo s vremena na vrijeme Well yeah from time to time T Yes and no because he is soccer player and he is like he doesn t have time to meet with her and contact with her INTERVIEWER Okay that makes sense And this is your cat over here What is your cats name INTERVIEWEE Nema imena She has no name T No name Cat INTERVIEWER No name Just cat INTERVIEWEE Yes Ina e sam uvijek imala elju ma ka je od gazdarice ovdje koju smo mi donijeli u ku u Yes I ve always wanted the cat belongs to my land lady here we brought it into the house T So here in Sarajevo she lives in a house and I mean not her house she s renting one fl INTERVIEWER A flat or an apartment T Mhm And it s a cat from her the owner of the house So there are lots of little cats and that one belongs to them like she always wanted a cat INTERVIEWER So what emotions do you have when you think about your cat INTERVIEWEE Nekako imam vi e osje aj da me ivotinje bolje razumiju nego I somehow have the feeling that animals understand me better than T She thinks INTERVIEWEE Imaju i dosta vi e osje aja They re also a lot more sensitive T She thinks INTERVIEWEE Bar ja to mislim At least I think so T Animals have more feelings than people Not like have more feelings just ona ima cuku you have a dog Animals have more feelings than people Not like have more feelings just she has a doggy you have a dog INTERVIEWER I have a dog his name is Moscow T Zove se Moskva His name is Moscow INTERVIEWER And how old this cat looks like a baby so INTERVIEWEE Ona je jo uvijek beba ima 4 sedmice She s still a baby she s 4 weeks old T 4 weeks INTERVIEWER So just a little one INTERVIEWEE Za nju se ba treba brinuti kao za malu kao za dijete Taking care of her is like taking care of a baby T She said you have to like be more careful and to like Because she s a baby she s just 4 weeks old you have to be like a mother INTERVIEWER You have to be very caring and T Mhm INTERVIEWER Yeah So if he does she sleep with you And you have to make sure you don t go on top of him or her INTERVIEWEE Spavamo u istoj sobi i stalno sam tu ali ono budi me nave er We sleep in the same room and I m constantly there but like she wakes me up at night T Mama They sleep in the same room but other bed And like when the cat has to pee or something it wakes her so lot of responsibility Mom They sleep in the same room but other bed And like when the cat has to pee or something it wakes her so lot of responsibility INTERVIEWER Yeah But I m sure you like taking care of this cat so INTERVIEWEE Ne predstavlja mi nikakav nije mi te ko It doesn t present it isn t hard for me T It s not hard INTERVIEWER And you care about her Yeah That s really great And then I know what this is cause I saw Renko signing hundreds of them And so can you tell me I don t understand why you have to have a book that s paper it would get lost very easily I would assume so so is it hard to keep up with or not really The university is currently in the process of moving from paper to digital record keeping although it manages this with limited success as it currently presents twice the amount of bureaucratic procedures for students T Jel ga te ko uvati ono No it s for our grades We need to the teachers just to sign them and then to like grade Is it hard to take care of like No it s for our grades We need to the teachers just to sign them and then to like grade INTERVIEWER That you were there T Mhm INTERVIEWER Oh okay T And to we need it just when the finals are coming just to for grades and for the signings These are given for class attendance and present a prerequisite to take an exam INTERVIEWER Okay So what s significant about this picture T ta je posebno za tu sliku What s special about this picture INTERVIEWEE Znam Pa ne znam Za mene je upis na fakultet predstavio dosta toga zato to sam uvijek htjela to i smatram da bi sa fakultetom jedino mogla ne to uspijeti pogotovo ovdje I izabrala sam ne to to volim i A psihologiju sam izabrala ba da bi razumijela bolje I know Well I don t know Getting accepted into the university represented a lot of things for me because it s something I ve always wanted and I find that I can only be successful if I finish college especially here And I chose something I love and And I chose psychology specifically to understand people better T So this picture doesn t just like represent the book it represents the getting to college she she wanted psychology to understand more people more And like it s a new step in her life and ta si ti ono jo rekla So this picture doesn t just like represent the book it represents the getting to college she she wanted psychology to understand more people more And like it s a new step in her life and What else did you say INTERVIEWEE Izabrala sam ono to volim I chose something I love T She choose something she loves to study something she loves INTERVIEWEE Nisam uzimala druge opcije to je to mi je bila ono jedina I didn t take other options that was that was like the only one for me T She doesn t she didn t have a plan B just psychology INTERVIEWER Oh okay And what do you want to do with psychology T ta e raditi kao psiholog What are you going to do as a psychologist INTERVIEWEE Pa ne znam dosta me zanima psihologija dje ja i roditeljstva ba zbog onog to sam ja pro la Well i don t know I m pretty interested in childrens and parenting psychology specifically because of what I went through T So child psychology and psychology I don t know how you say it INTERVIEWEE Parents T For parents to give advice and something INTERVIEWER Like marriage and family therapy P T Mhm mhm INTERVIEWEE Something like that T Because of like INTERVIEWER What you went through as a child That makes sense Did you see a marriage and family I don t know if you have them here a marriage and family therapist Or did you see T We have them Jesi i la ikad kod tih We have them Did you ever see one INTERVIEWEE Ne No T She didn t went to them INTERVIEWER So you think that going to a marriage and family counselor could really help a situation Maybe help work on some tense areas or some issues INTERVIEWEE Smatram da bi razgovor sa osobom koja dobro poznaje to polje pomogao to tom paru ili ne to Bolje je jer mislim da razgovor samo sa prijateljima ne mo e pomo i koliko sa odre enom osobom I find that a conversation with a person who has a thorough understanding of the field could help a couple or something I think it s better because I don t think conversations only with friends can help as much as with a particular person T So she thinks when for example she finishes school and be the counselor INTERVIEWER Yeah T She thinks it s better to see a psychologist or like to that the couple will stay together and it s better to speak to a psychologist not with friends and family and INTERVIEWER So having a neutral mediator in between T Imati neutralnog medijatora je bolje nego prijatelji Having a neutral mediator is better than friends INTERVIEWEE Da Yes INTERVIEWER And in between the 2 individuals so that INTERVIEWEE Mislim da je tu najbolje ta neutralna osoba Zna i posavjetova e te onako kako treba a ne e biti pristrana jednoj strani ili drugoj strani i re i kako je zaista I think that a neutral person is the best solution So he she will counsel them adequately but won t be biased towards either side and will say how it really is T So she thinks that a neutral person will like guide you and tell you the better way Not like friends maybe friends will choose a side and it s better to like INTERVIEWER To have that And what are some other obstacles you ve had to overcome to get to this point of studying psychology T Can you repeat please INTERVIEWER What are other significant moments in your life that you ve had to go through to get to this point T Aha Jel ima drugih osim toga to za tvoju porodicu i to to si upisala psihologiju Jel ima drugih razloga Aha Are there others besides the ones related to your family that made you choose psychology Are there other reasons INTERVIEWEE Ne jednostavno sam jednostavno volim to i ne znam Nekako se najbolje pronalazim u tome svemu No I simply it s simply something I love and I don t know Somehow I feel most comfortable in it T She just like psychology and she finds INTERVIEWER Fascinating INTERVIEWEE Uvijek sam bila tu drugima kad treba ne to su uvijek svi dolazili meni uvijek sam ja tad bila neka I was always there for others when they needed something they always came to me I was always some sort of T Like she was the like psychologist to her friends and she find her in that INTERVIEWEE Uvijek su mi govorili da nalazim najbolja rje enja za njih i They always told me that I found the best solutions for them and T When INTERVIEWEE Nisam ih osu ivala uvijek sam saslu ala i tako to I didn t judge them I always heard them out and so on T When her friends had a problem they came to her and then she would like clear the problem and they said that she was the best in that and She always listened and she didn t judge and tako INTERVIEWER That s great This song is everyone is singing it It s okay And then can you tell me a little about JMBG I know that there was a huge you called them demonstrations Protest This comes from literally translating the Bosnian word for protest T Aha Kad su bili oni protesti za JMBG Aha When we had protests for the JMBG s INTERVIEWER Last summer T Mhm INTERVIEWER Can you talk to me a little about did that affect you in any way Or anyone that you know INTERVIEWEE Pa nije ba da puno znam o tome Well I don t really know much about it T She doesn t know a lot of about that INTERVIEWEE Nisam bila I wasn t T I mean are you do you know what happened INTERVIEWER All I know is that there was a hashtag JMBG and president Obama was holding a sign that said JMBG and I know T Really INTERVIEWER Yeah T I didn t know about that INTERVIEWER Yeah And so I don t know a lot I didn t I recognized it when you and I was like Is that what this is about T So when you are born here in Bosnia you have like your INTERVIEWEE Jedinstveni broj Unique Unique number Unique T Like unique number citizen number unique citizen number And the story with the hashtag JMBG was like last year a baby was born and she was born like sick She had something and she was a baby in hospital and they wouldn t treat her because she didn t have the JMBG because she was just a baby And when you are born INTERVIEWER Oh you don t get your JMBG when you re a baby T You INTERVIEWER After you re born T Yeah after you re born like Kako se dobija ono Kad kad se upisuje Yeah after you re born like How do you get it again When when you re signed in INTERVIEWEE Kad se upisuje u mati nu knjigu When you re signed into the master registry The Mati na knjiga fulfills the same role as the General Register Office in most Commonwealth countries that is it keeps record of births deaths and marriages of a nations citizens T Ali kako se to So a baby is born and then like parents choose name and and when they choose name they like But how would you So a baby is born and then like parents choose name and and when they choose name they like INTERVIEWEE Kao na oficijelno stavi je na oficijelno mislim mo e to re i official Well on the official you make it official I think you can say that official T So you have to have name surname JMBG and to get a passport for example INTERVIEWER Okay T And she didn t have a passport because she didn t had JMBG And here in Bosnia they weren t enough good enough doctors so she had to go I don t know Croatia but she didn t had a passport because she didn t have the JMBG and the parents were like they couln t they hadn t had enough time to INTERVIEWER Get a JMBG T Yes INTERVIEWER You have to apply to get a JMBG like paperwork Or T It s a paperwork because like kako bi rekla It s a paperwork because like how can I say INTERVIEWEE ta ho e What do you want T Zna ono da se mora svako upisati u mati nu knjigu ro enih You know like how everyone has to be signed into the master registry INTERVIEWEE T It important to do you have an I D Maybe I can show you on your I don t know how to explain it it s when you re born you have to like law INTERVIEWER I don t know if I have that I don t have a JMBG obviously T What s this INTERVIEWER My that s my drivers license number T Ahh and this INTERVIEWER My birthday T Birthday and okay INTERVIEWER Expiration date which is coming up T Mhm mhm So no INTERVIEWER I have an I D though like a US I D I don t have it with me I don t know where it s at But like a I have a social security number is what we call them Social security number so it s like that but I think that it like when you re born this is why I m I think I m a little confused in the US you re just born you have a name birthday birth week you re assigned a number like those that you don t have to apply you just T No you don t have to apply it s just like when you you re born and you have to like you don t have to apply just to sign in the books of of born babies and INTERVIEWER Oh okay So that hadn t happened T And it it s like a number your number INTERVIEWER So if that only happened with one baby T Two INTERVIEWER Two babies T Mhm INTERVIEWER Okay sorry So then that is what raised the protests T Mhm mhm INTERVIEWER Cause of the two babies T Mhm I Wow so that was a big protest For two babies T Because they didn t have the best treatment because they couln t go outside of Bosnia The protests were sparked by the death of an infant as a result of the governments inability to reach an adequate solution to the issue of JMBG s before it came to the incident INTERVIEWER So it sounds like the people here really care what happens to other people T Yeah it s not like it s not because of other people it s of because of politics Because the politics is like the politic the government said You can t go to other countries if you don t have the JMBG and people protested because because they wouldn t let the baby and the parents go to a better doctor without the JMBG and the politics was like really important in that So people protested protested to politics not like for babies INTERVIEWER Oh okay Something I didn t know I m really getting confused but I think I have it all figured out T Me too so It happened just like in Sarajevo not like in Zenica INTERVIEWER Oh so it was just in Sarajevo T Mhm To ono za JMBG kad je bio protest You can just google and Mhm That like the JMBG thing when the protests happened You can just google and INTERVIEWER Find And then is this a picture of your studies INTERVIEWEE Yes INTERVIEWER Finals are here Are they over yet T No INTERVIEWEE No Tek po inju No They re just beginning T Just beginning INTERVIEWEE Ovo je samo po elo trenutno zna i zadnjih par mjeseci ta mi se de ava sa u enjem This just began at the moment so like what s been happening to me with studying in the last few months T So To je i kod mene This is what she sees every day and for months like for like last 4 months So It s like that with me too This is what she sees every day and for months like for like last 4 months INTERVIEWEE To je ono to mi je sad zaokupilo misli That s what s preoccupying my thoughts right now INTERVIEWER Yeah lots of study lots of work That looks like you would use that in statistics T Mhm INTERVIEWEE Yes To je ono to mi stvara najvi e problema Yes That s the source of my biggest problems T It s the INTERVIEWEE I najvi e mi zaokuplja misli And it s preoccupying my thoughts the most T The biggest problem in school INTERVIEWER I was telling other people I have some resources that I can send out for statistics that UCLA developed and it might help you They come up with like guides to help introduce and I ll send you guys I wrote it down on my to do list INTERVIEWEE Oh okay T So it s like this picture represents her life in last 4 5 months just learning and INTERVIEWEE Ne to emu sam se najvi e posvetila i sve sam ostalo odbacila Something I ve devoted myself to the most I ve neglected everything else T Everything everything has to wait just statistics and INTERVIEWER Yeah And I can see that you re is this where you have to write out the equations T It s this is like when we take notes we We mark the important things It s our choice if we like do this Ona misli da je to da to mora It s this is like when we take notes we We mark the important things It s our choice if we like do this She thinks that that s that it has to be like that INTERVIEWER Highlight T Mhm We highlight what we think is important INTERVIEWER It s a pretty good picture Statistics I think that in psychology most people don t like statistics It s okay I understand And tell me about this picture INTERVIEWEE To je zato to sam se dosta vezala sad i mislim da je prava sre a na i ovakve prijatelje na fakultetu That s because I m really attached now and I think that I m really lucky to find such friends in university T Hvala ti Thank you INTERVIEWEE Haj sad prevedi Now translate T These are my new friends and I think it s really great to find people like this on like here INTERVIEWEE Na fakultetu ina e svako gleda sebe In universities people generally just look out for themselves T For example people are just looking for people are selfish and most of them are selfish and like not caring about other INTERVIEWEE Vi niste takve You re not like that T So we are not I mean these people are not like INTERVIEWER They look very familiar It s a good picuture T Thank you I know I know INTERVIEWER So this is a group of friends that have really influenced your first year here at the faculty of philosopy or psychology And you guys are pretty you guys are really it sounds like a close group of friends yeah T Mhm INTERVIEWER But you are all different in your own ways And you have similarities that you share What are some of the most what is something that when you look at this picture what kind of feelings do you are evoked INTERVIEWEE Sre a Happiness T ta osje a kad vidi ovu sliku Kad vidi te ljude What do you feel when you look at this picture When you see these people INTERVIEWEE Pa padne mi na pamet koliko se smijemo zajedno kad smo i Well I think of how much we laugh when we re together and T I think of happiness INTERVIEWEE Kako mi brzo pro e vrijeme s vama How time flies by with you T And how it s too how great is to spend time with them and INTERVIEWEE Nekako je ljep e i i na fakultet kad zna da ima jo pored u enja nekog ko e te tamo do ekati It s somehow nicer going to university when you know that there s more besides studying someone who ll be there with you T So it s great about faculty to besides learning and going to classes to have friends and to like to have friends there INTERVIEWER And then you guys are from all over Bosnia yeah So you didn t know each other before INTERVIEWEE No INTERVIEWER And then you meet at the faculty and where do you see your future relationship As friends INTERVIEWEE Mhm Pa volila bi da ostanemo dosta dosta dugo u kontaktu Mhm Well I d like us to stay in contact for a really really long time T I poslije And after INTERVIEWEE I poslije fakulteta zna i to nije vezano samo za fakultet nego And after school so it isn t just related to university but T So it s not like I would to she would like to be friends with them after INTERVIEWER After faculty T After faculty and more and more years INTERVIEWER So maybe developing some lifelong friendships here T Mhm Da ono budemo do ivotno Mhm To like be lifelong INTERVIEWER And has anyone demonstrated to you what a lifelong friendship looks like T Jel ti From the or Did From the or INTERVIEWER From anyone do you know anyone that has had a lifelong friendship T Jel ti iko jel zna ikog ko ima tako dugo prijateljstvo ono dugo dugo dugo Did anyone do you know anyone who has a long friendship like long long long INTERVIEWEE Imam s Tamarom takvo prijateljstvo od 12 godina I have a friendship like that with Tamara for 12 years T She and her best friend they are friends for 12 years INTERVIEWER Oh okay And then I guess when I think about friends how did you learn to become a good friend INTERVIEWEE Ne znam I don t know T That s a tough question INTERVIEWEE Ne znam stvarno I really don t know T I don t know it just happened INTERVIEWER It just happened Yeah like trial and error type of stuff Mistakes here learning from mistakes and then it sounds like you have a pretty solid foundation or solid way to T Solidna prijateljstva ili Solid friendships or INTERVIEWER You know how to form a relationship T Zna kako stvoriti prijateljstvo sad You know how to form a friendship now INTERVIEWER And to continue Do you think that is there anyone in your life that has that has had a lifelong friendship Not with you maybe like T Jel ima jo neko pored vas Ne s tobom nego zna li nekog ko ima dugo prijateljstvo naprimjer tvoja sestra tvoja mama tvoji neko iz Anyone besides you Not with you but do you know anyone who has a long term friendship like your sister mom your someone from INTERVIEWEE Mama sa Mom with INTERVIEWER Yeah it s hard to think INTERVIEWEE Ne znam ih toliko jedino su ono rodbinski povezano prijateljstvo I don t know of that many only like familial friendships T Not really just INTERVIEWEE Naprimjer sestre ili ne to ali ne znam ba puno ovako da su For example sisters or something but I don t really know many that are T Maybe cousins that are like friends like long INTERVIEWER Like cousin friends but T Not like friends friends just cousins that are really good friends INTERVIEWER I think that that s really interesting because I think that that leads to my last question which is can you describe reconciliation or healing in in the Balkan community or in Bosnia in any way And I think that you kind of answered it for me I think that it might be found in lifelong friendships And T Da se pomogne ono da opstane Bosna To help like keep Bosnia whole INTERVIEWER Would you agree T A ti si ustvari odgovorila na to kad si rekla da da dugoro no prijateljstvo to mo e jel se sla e sa tim And you actually answered that when you said that that long term friendships can do you agree with that INTERVIEWEE Mhm INTERVIEWER And and having a lifelong friendship sounds really great but it s a lot of work right So I guess my question is what kind of what kind when you think of a lifelong friendship what do you what do you think it s going to take in order to achieve that Or in order to form that or to stay friends T Kako bi op In order to main INTERVIEWEE Opstalo jel Maintain T Aha INTERVIEWEE Mislim da bi tu dosta trebalo raditi zna i ne znam I think it requires lots of work like I don t know T It needs hard work Ono da bude ti ti svoja ti uglavnom It needs hard work Like to be yourself essentially INTERVIEWEE Da Yes T Just to be yourself and INTERVIEWEE Ne znam da ne vu e na svoju stranu kako e to re i I don t know to not to be too unrelenting how are you going to say that T Not like to INTERVIEWEE Kompromis izme u vas dvoje da zlatnu sredinu mo ete na i u svemu Compromising between you two that you can always find the golden mean T To find compromise if you have some issue and with everything to find compromise not to like INTERVIEWER Just T Just Me me me you you just INTERVIEWER Yeah So sharing having an equal balanace to your friendship or to your relationships I think that that is really difficult to do and it s not really demonstrated well for us to do Does that makes sense INTERVIEWEE Mislim da tra i dosta odricanja i razmi ljanja i I think it requires plenty of sacrificing and thinking and T Bless you It it Kako si rekla Tra i dosta Bless you It it What did you say It requires plenty of INTERVIEWEE Dosta odricanja Plenty of sacrifice T Odricanja It needs to be ne znam kako se ka e odricanje ima li neka druga rije Like to I don t know the word like Kako bi joj objasnila ono da Sacrifice It needs to be I don t know how to say sacrifice is there another word Like to I don t know the word like How could I explain it like INTERVIEWEE Da ne to mora ostaviti radi That you have to put something aside because of T You have to like put something aside for friend INTERVIEWER Yeah so putting their needs first before yours T Ma ja tako ne to Yeah something like that INTERVIEWER Yeah I think that I think that when you guys have talked to me about the future of Bosnia and what reconciliation looks like in the memory of this Balkan community and all the stuff that it s gone through I think that I m really hopeful for the future of Bosnia Most of you are 19 and are super young but it seems like you have a really open mind and a good grasp on kind of what s going on here in the community and kind of pushing to do something different and does that make sense like it seems like that when I talk to you guys You re like I don t know T Can you just repeat the beginning of the question INTERVIEWER Oh it s not a question I was just it was a statement T The statement yeah sorry INTERVIEWER I think that when you guys have been talking to me about the Balkan community what is looks like now and kind of what you re doing whether it s just forming friendships wanting to form lifelong friendships wanting to be open minded to accept other people not to judge I think that that is very significant in the way that you can move forward in this community and it s almost like if you guys all work together and do those things that it that Bosnia would not be stuck that it would move forward Because you understand what it takes and almost the simple concepts and you re willing to do the hard work does that make sense You re willing to you know even have friendships if you were able to have a lifelong friendship that s a pretty big deal And so and it s something that hasn t been modeled for you in the past so by being able to overcome that barrier I think that it would be that that is why this these photos are so empowering Does that makes sense Kind of INTERVIEWEE Mhm INTERVIEWER Yeah I think that this is why photos speak a lot they the whole story or a lot of your life story So it s been really good to sit down and interview and to kind of gain insight into what do young adults of Bosnia think Because no one knows and I don t know so it s been really good to just talk and What do you think about these things This is something that I do in the US is this what you do here I don t know help me understand so it s been really really good Yeah Do you have any questions for me No P T No INTERVIEWER No questions Well I m going to e mail you this cause I ve read this a million times Thank you for participating in my interview if you ve experienced any discomfort emotionally and feel that you need to talk with a professional counselor dr Renko is available you can e mail him or call him and if you have any other questions or concerns about this study you can always e mail me and I will respond So yeah thank you for participating'"
