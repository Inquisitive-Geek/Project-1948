       "'I: Okay. We\\'re gonna go ahead and get started and I just want to go over this form with you saying that I have consent from Chicago School of Professional Psychology to conduct research with you and that these photographs can be used, but your name wont be attached to them. And that I also have consent to verbally record this and your name will never be attached to this as well, I\\'ll relabel it as participant 1. Your name wont be used at any publication and then you\\'re also agreeing that you would make no monetary claim against the Chicago School of Professional Psychology for the use of these photographs or this recording. Do I have you consent?  P: Yes, you do have my consent.  I: Thank you. Alright. Well I printed off these photographs and I\\'m gonna go ahead and give them to you, they\\'re in an envolope. And so.. I really like you photos. I thought that they were really, really good. So, I just kind of want to get to know you a little bit here. So, how old are you?  P: I\\'m nineteen. I will be twenty\\xa0in a month.  I: Oh, when is your birthday?  P: On 1st of July.\\xa0  I: Nice. So, you\\'re almost twenty and so you are in you first.. you\\'re finishing your first year of psychology.  P: Yes.  I: At the faculty of philosophy, at the University of Sarajevo. Are you comfortable sharing which national identity.. you associate with?  P: Well, I can\\'t say that I\\'m uncomfortable, but I don\\'t really like to bring that up.\\xa0  I: Oh, okay, that\\'s totally fine and that\\'s okay. So, at any time if you feel uncomfortable asking or answering a question, just let me know and if at any time you want to stop and pause, that\\'s fine to. Okay?  P: Okay.\\xa0  I: Alright. So, what about this first picture here. This is really interesting. I really like this picture.\\xa0  P: So...  I: Can you tell me a little bit about it?  P: This is a friend of mine. Her name is Tea, and she is Jewsih. She comes from a Jewish family, but she\\'s an atheist. She\\' really not religious and she\\'s so open-minded, like one of the most open-minded person I\\'ve ever met, if I can.. if that\\'s grammatically correct... (laughs)  I: No, that is perfectly correct.  P: Okay, good. But she.. she goes, you know, to\\xa0synagogue, and she prays regularly. Not because she feels.. that she wants to do that, but because of her parents and because of the tradition. So, what I really wanted to say with this picture is how.. religion is really important in Bosnia. It\\'s, like, very important, especially after the war. Practically if you say that you don\\'t.. you don\\'t have any religious belifs, that you don\\'t believe in God it\\'s like: \"Wow! What the hell is wrong with you?\".. you know?  I: Really?  P: Yeah. So, practically, she told me that she just can\\'t tell her parents that she doesn\\'t believe in God, that she\\'s not religious, that she doesn\\'t feel anything inside here, you know, when you mention God, or anything like that. But, she has to.. she has to pray, she has to be religious, in front of them... So, I think it\\'s really, I don\\'t know.. tragic and sad. She can\\'t be what she really is.. that she has to pretend.\\xa0  I: Yeah, it sounds like she\\'s been a really influential person in your life.\\xa0  P: Yeah, she was.  I: And how long have you known her?  P: I\\'ve known her about a year. But, since the first time we spoke, we like clicked, you know, when that happens?  I: Yeah.  P: You know.. I perfectly understand what she\\'s saying, and she understands what I\\'m saying, so we became really good friends.  I: She seems really great. So, it\\'s almost like she has to go through the motions, just to please her parents.\\xa0  P: Exactly.  I: I think that.. I think that I found that a lot in this younger generation. So, I don\\'t find.. you mentioned that in Bosnia everyone seems to gravitate toward your religion? So that\\'s new to me, can you talk to me a little bit more about that?  P: Well sure. I can tell you about myself.\\xa0  I: Okay, yeah.  P: For example.. so, I was raised in very.. religious parents, you know? And ever since I was born I was thought to be a Muslim, that my religion is Islam, you know.. that I have to go to a.. I don\\'t know how to say in English (laughs).  I: A mosque.  P: A mosque, okay. You know, I have to read Qur\\'an, I have to pray to God five times a day...  I: Wow, that\\'s a lot of times.  P: Exactly, and many, many other things. And I really did do that, I used to be really religious, very religious person. And then, like, I don\\'t know.. about two-three years ago I suddenly started thinking with my own mind. I didn\\'t.. I stopped listening to my parents and everything they taught me and I.. I was like: \"Hang on a second, let me see what do I think about all of that\". And then, I suddenly realized how.. how stupid I was. I\\'m sorry, I don\\'t know if you\\'re religious, but I just think it\\'s really dumb, it offends human intelligence, really much.  I: Something interesting I think that you just said was that you started thinking for yourself about a year ago. Is that when you enrolled in university?  P: Yes.  I: That was when you began... By chance, did you take a Introduction to Philosophy course or..? What was your class schedule like then?  P: I had philosophy class in high school and I.. I really loved it. Everyone else hated it, you know, because it was so complicated: \"What the hell does that mean?\" (both laugh). But I really loved it because I kind of understood what all those philosophers were trying to say. But I don\\'t think that\\'s what caused me to stop being religious. I think.. I don\\'t know.. just something just happened inside of me, by the way, maybe it has something to do with the fact that I became a vegeterian, about two years ago. And in Islam, it\\'s actually okay to kill animals for food, and I don\\'t agree with that that\\'s just so wrong. I don\\'t think anyone deserves to be killed just for ten minutes of somebody\\'s pleasure. So, I think that\\'s very wrong. So, it probably has something to do with that. And also, I really, really love science, I\\'m so interested in that. And I can\\'t believe it.. it pains me, how much money people spend to religion, and everything about that, and how little they invest in science, especially in Bosnia.\\xa0  I: Yeah. So can you explain a little bit.. everyone kind of tells me that here, but I don\\'t know exactly what that means. So, how is money being invested into religion here, and not into science?\\xa0  P: Well, they\\'re building.. how did you say again (laughs)?  I: Oh, mosque.  P: Mosque... That\\'s so embarrassing.  I: No, no.  P: Okay.  I: How do you say it in Bosnian?  P: Džamija.\\xa0  I: Džamija?  P: Yeah. So, they\\'re investing a lot of money to build mosques and all sorts of other objects.. buildings and everything. And they spend a lot of money on.. it\\'s called terabija.\\xa0  I: Te-ra-bija.  P: Terabija. It\\'s a.. a kind of tradition after Ramazan. Did you hear about that? It.. it\\'s a... I can\\'t say a holiday, but...  I: Oh yeah. It\\'s like a... Is it with the commemoration?  P: Something like that.  I: Yeah.  P: Anyway, I don\\'t want to bother you with the explanation, they spend a lot of money on that.\\xa0  I: So, it\\'s investing still.. is this the government that\\'s still investing into religion, and the buildings and these commemorations and then not putting it toward schooling?  P: Yes, exactly. Did you see the lab in our university?  I: I didn\\'t.\\xa0  P: I mean the \"lab\".  I: (Laughs) I did not. No one showed me. Can you explain to me what it looks like?  P: Well, it\\'s like a room with lots of computers. And that\\'s a lab...  I: So it\\'s not like a real, research science lab, that you would imagine to have.  P: Exactly. And everytime we have to do an experiment \\xa0for.. to get extra points, you know.. in some class or just to do... I don\\'t know.. an essay or something.. we go to that lab and it.. it\\'s so ridiculous. They call that an experiment. I think that\\'s...  I: Oh, and was that one of the experiments that everyone was taking part of when I came to.. the classroom, the other evening...  P: Yeah.  I: Behavioural statistics? You were taking a part of an experiment in that lab?  P: Yes.  I: I was wondering. I\\'ve heard a couple of other things, like that from students. They\\'ve told me similar things, but I didn\\'t know exactly, so thank you for sharing, now I understand a little bit more of how everything works. Your friend here in this picture.. has any.. do you know of any stories or memories that she has had with the Balkan conflict? You mentioned that she\\'s.. her parents are religious and they\\'re forcing her into religion, is that related to the Balkan conflict at all?  P: Yes, especially since she\\'s Jewish. Because Muslims don\\'t really like Jews, I don\\'t know did you know that?   I: I did not.  P: Because they take.. what\\'s it called.. you know when you borrow money from bank, and then when you return it, you return double..?  I: Oh, like interest loan.  P: Something like that. The Jewish people do that, and Muslims think it\\'s wrong, it says so in their book, in Qur\\'an. So they don\\'t really like them. And many other things in history of Islam happened between Muslims and Jews. That caused to be so.. like enemies, you know?\\xa0  I: Yeah.  P: So, yeah. She actually gets into lot of conflicts with people, because they are trying to teach her on her Jewish history, and she knows better than them, and then they.. they practica;ly fighting...  I: Who was trying to teach her Jewish histroy?\\xa0  P: I don\\'t know. There was this guy who\\'s always around in this cafe where we go out, and we both know him, but we don\\'t really like him. So, he comes and he sits with us, and everything\\'s fine until they start talking about religion. I hate.. I would just run away.\\xa0  I: And is it pretty common to talk about religion?  P: Yes actually. I don\\'t know.. everytime I go out it somehow happens that they start talking about religion and which religion is older, which book is better and I.. hate that.  I: Yeah.  P: And I\\'m begging them like: \"Please, can we change the subject, I really don\\'t want to talk about...\", \"No, no, no, no! Hang on a second.\" (laughs), and they just keep talking.  I: So it\\'s a pretty popular topic amoung young people right now. Is it the religion that their parents presented with them, or for them, or is it their own religion or is it both that they\\'re talking about?  P: Well I think it\\'s kind of like I said, you know? Parents are the one who teach us to be religious, but then some people stick with that, and some people just start, you know, they think for themselves.\\xa0  I: Yeah, and so, it seems like you\\'ve kind of found a group that you want to be around, that think for themselves.  P: Yeah, I have.  I: And, not only in the religious matter, but in the scientific matter and the economic matter. So it seems like you\\'re wanting to be more of an independent thinker\\xa0  P: You could say so.  I: Yeah.\\xa0May I look\\xa0at some other of these pictures? What is...  P: Oh this one\\'s really bad.\\xa0  I: No, this one\\'s really great. What is this one?  P: It\\'s a bad quality... So, it\\'s a building, it\\'s near the train station. I don\\'t know, maybe you\\'ve seen it. That.. it was destroyed in the war and next to it is another, really fancy building, but I couldn\\'t take pictures of both, so I took just of this one, and I decided to tell you, you know. And it\\'s really.. I think they left it like this on purpose, so the people can remember what happened in the war, and so they can never forget it, because that\\'s kind of the ideology of Bosnia: “Don\\'t forget! Never forget, never forgive!“.  I: I\\'m starting to pick up on that. I\\'ve been here for three weeks and.. last monday in the US, our holiday was Memorial Day, so we honor like, veterans, people that fought in the war. And so, I made a comment, and I said: \"Every day is Memorial Day in Bosnia\", cause I feel like everyday, there is something here that\\'s [cant understand you over the participant], that\\'s commemorating. Can you tell me a little bit more about how.. how Bosnia continually commemorates.. it seems like every day or every beginning of something or end of something or...  P: Well, there\\'s a, a kind of.. how do you say, just memorial...  I: A memorial, commemoration...\\xa0  P: On the 11th of July, in Srebrenica. They.. so every year they\\'re looking for the remains of the people who were murdered in the war. So, what they find, they bury them on that day and millions of people whose families were murdered in the war.. they come there and they mourn their beloved ones and there\\'s a.. I don\\'t maybe there\\'s even.. like a reading of.. I\\'m not sure exactly what.. anyways, like parts of Qur\\'an.. they also read their names and they remember them, and stuff like that. So that\\'s one of them, but, like you said, I feel like every day is a Memorial Day in Bosnia, because no matter what happenes, people will always include religion in that.  I: Yeah, always.  P: Like, for example, I don\\'t know have you heard that recently, like half of Bosnia has been flooded. So, they said it\\'s a punishment from God, becuase there was supposed to be a homosexual parade.. a.. how do you say, Parade of Pride, here in Sarajevo, and that\\'s God punishing us for wanting to do that.\\xa0  I: But Sarajevo wasn\\'t flooded, right?  P: It wasn\\'t, but.. you know.\\xa0  I: (Laughs) So that\\'s what everyone\\'s saying. What do you think?  P: About?  I: About the flood.  P: Well, I think it\\'s a natural disaster, you know..? It happens. The God has nothing to do with that, of course. And I just.. especially including homosexuals in that.. that is the most stupid thing I\\'ve ever heard. What do they have to do with that? Nothing. So I think it\\'s a natural disaster, so help people as much\\xa0as you can and that\\'s it, get over it. Forget God, and religion and punishment, it has nothing to do with God.  I: Yeah. Do you feel that people have been helping each other during this massive flooding?  P: Yes, they definitely have. Which is one of the good things in Bosnia, people always help each other, no matter what happenes. For example, many people, they have like leukemia, or cancer, or very uncureable diseases and there is no treatment.. no proper treatment in Bosnia for them, so they have to go to Germany and some other countries and of course they don\\'t have enough money for that. And we always have like these phone numbers, so you can call, to donate money and people always call, and in the end they always collect enough money to go to other countries and that\\'s great.  I: Aww, that\\'s great. I think I\\'ve noticed that too, as a city center, in the streets of Sarajevo, there would be like a picture of someone that has like [cerebral p..?] or something, trying to fundraise for it. So it seems like the Bosnian people want to help each other.  P: Yes, they do.  I: And it seems like maybe this flood has helped them come together. In ways maybe..?  P: Well, we\\'re all hoping for that, but... I\\'m not so sure.  I: You\\'re not so sure? What are you not sure about?  P: Well, I, you know, during the floods the Bosniaks were helping the Serbs, and Serbs were helping Croatians and everything, but I think that.. after this all is over, they will go back to hating each other. No matter what they did for each other at that period when everyone needed help... I think when it calms down, everyone will just go back to their previous lifestyle.  I: Yeah. Why do you think people will go back to hating each other?  P: I don\\'t know. It\\'s just... It\\'s been going on for too many years.. for almost twenty years... For me to think that something could actually change, like ever.  I: So it\\'s kind of just repeating itself, over and over again?  P: Yes. And I think it wouldn\\'t happen if our parents didn\\'t teach us to hate.\\xa0  I: Oh, so you parents taught you.  P: That\\'s what they do.  I: What did your parents teach you?  P: They taught me that I should never trust a Serb, that they\\'re bad people, that they will always try to trick me, they will never help me.. you know? They may be good friends to me at some period, but then they\\'ll always go back to each other, you know? And.. just, just.. stay away from them, that\\'s what they taught me. And I.. I don\\'t do that, I actually have many friends who are Serbs, and they are great people. We don\\'t talk about that at all, about our, you know..?  I: Yeah.  P: I need to work on my vocabulary (chuckles).\\xa0  I: No, your English is perfect. I can understand you so well.  P: Anyway, you know what I mean.\\xa0  I: Yeah, I do know what you mean.  P: But, many people.. they.. they listen to their parents, and they, you know.. about what they thought them.. and they hate.\\xa0  I: They still hate each other? They still feel it\\'s kind of like parents are teaching children, their children, the emotions that they had.  P: Exactly.  I: Against the other party, or the other ethnicity, and then they\\'re trying to continue those emotions with their children...  P: Yes.  I: So... But with you.. you said that you don\\'t.. you didn\\'t take a part of those emotions?  P: I didn\\'t.  I: How did you stop that?  P: Well, to be fair, I never really began.. you know?  I: Oh, okay.  P: And, you know, even though they were teaching me.. they didin\\'t actually say: \"Hate them\", but all of the things they said.. it implicated to.. that I should hate.  I: Can you give me an example of what your parents would say?  P: Well, like I said, you know... Things like: “They\\'re not good people, they\\'re bad, they\\'re.. they will never help you, in the end they will always betray you...“, and things like that, because that\\'s what happened to them, it\\'s really what happened. I know that, I believe that, but I don\\'t think that everybody in Serbia is like that. There is just some certian amount of bad people, or actually one bad person, who led.. a huge amount of other people to do bad things. I don\\'t think everyone is like that, and especially the new generations. I think if we all could just be reasonable and look at the facts as they really are, then we would.. we could be able to be friends again.  I: I really enjoyed listening to you, your perspective, you really are open-minded. It seems like you have thought this through with friends, and it\\'s not that you just thought it through, you \\'ve acted upon it. So, the fact that you\\'re able to be.. identify with one group, but still had friends from all the\\xa0[ethnicities? – the recording gets distorted], no matter what their religion or [cant hear you] speaks volumes, for you, as a nineteen year old, almost twenty.. because, I feel like.. I feel like that is what this generation.. that is.. are going to be leading all of these.. if you stay in Bosnia.. will be leading all of these, whether you are in a psychology role or a government role.. I think that you are the future of Bosnia, and so, for you to be able to set yourself apart speaks volumes to the future of Bosnia, and how it can change. Do you feel hopeful?\\xa0  P: The problem about that is that many people like me are leaving Bosnia, for good. They never want to come...\\xa0  I: [I never...?] Yeah. Where do you want to leave?  P: Definitely.\\xa0  I: Okay. So you don\\'t want to stay, okay.  P: I know that people like me could help, but I just don\\'t think there is not enough of us and the time still hasn\\'t come, for that to be done. I think we need, at least twenty more years (laughs).  I: Twenty more years? So, I guess, perhaps, the other young people that I\\'ve talked to, everyone kind of says: \"Yeah, after I graduate school I want to go to Vienna, or Germany, or the US, or London...\" to pursue more education and then they.. I guess they plan on working there as well and staying there. You mention that in twenty years it might look differently in twenty years, most likely, you will have children. What will you tell your kids?  P: I\\'m not sure I want to have kids.\\xa0  I: Oh, okay.  P: No, really. I will have twenty-five cats.\\xa0  I: Oh, okay. You\\'ll have cats? Do you think nieces and nephews?\\xa0  P: I don\\'t know. I don\\'t think so, because I don\\'t have any brothers or sisters...  I: Oh, you don\\'t have any brothers or sisters?\\xa0  P: No. Really not many relatives at all.\\xa0  I: Okay. Do you think that you would have.. like, if you were in a teaching role, as like a professor, or teacher and you were around young students, and they asked you about the war, what would you tell them?  P: Well, first of all I would tell them that all wars are stupid things. And that they\\'re not worth all the trouble, definitely. And then I would tell them that.. what happened in Bosnia, of course, it happened and it\\'s a fact, it can\\'t be undone. But, we need to look forward, we need to go on, and try to recover from that and not just stay trapped in past, and hate, and endure and whatever. And that\\'s the only way that we could actually recover from that and start beginning new life and work on creating a better country, because right now it\\'s a complete mess.\\xa0  I: I\\'ve heard that too, that it is very, very messy. What are your feelings associated with the mess of the war that was twenty years ago?\\xa0  P: You mean how it...  I: Yeah, how does it make you feel when people talk about the war or when you see something that reminds you of a memory of the war...\\xa0  P: Okay, so.. I don\\'t really like to talk about that, because I haven\\'t been there, practically. I was born in 1994, and that\\'s one year before the war ended, so I was.. I was one year old when the war finished, and I don\\'t remember a thing. So, all I know is the stories that our parents told us.. but I don\\'t like talking about something when I haven\\'t been there. I really don\\'t like that. I also don\\'t like creating an opinion for one person, about.. based on what someone else said. I like to meet that person first and that\\'s the same thign with talking about war.\\xa0  I: Yeah.  P: So I try to avoid those conversations. But if I really have to participate in them, then I say what I just told you.\\xa0  I: Yeah. That you.. it sounds like you take all the facts [at your hand? And something else- that you?] have a very open mind and...  P: But people don\\'t really appreciate that...  I: They appreciate it.  P: Thank you (both laugh).  I: I appreciate your honesty. I think it\\'s very encouraging. Because also, I.. i prepped this project for about three years.. but the issue with what you were saying about science, was that there was not a lot of literature about Bosnian young adults, so I didn\\'t know anything. I didn\\'t know what you would think, and so I\\'m asking these questions, so that I can put them (in) literature: “This is what Bosnian young adults are thinking, please know this to be true“, because there is such a gap. So, that\\'s the wonderful about researchers, we can fill the gap. But.. thank you for being honest, and not.. carrying emotions that have been passed down and that you\\'re putting a stop to it, saying: \"No, I\\'m not participating in this foolishness\".. or...  P: Definitely.  I: Yeah, I\\'m really enjoying this conversation. Oh, and then you took a picture of a cat. Is this your cat? \\nP: No. This is the kitten I just gave to my friend.  I: Oh, yeah. You were talking about that.  P: You see, it\\'s.. his legs are broken.  I: Oh.  P: And if you can see clearly, he just drags them behind. Can I say she?  I: Yeah!  P: It\\'s kind of complicated to say it.\\xa0  I: Yeah, no (laughs).  P: Okay. So, she\\'s dragging them behind her when she walks, she walks just on two front legs. I found her... Actually a boy found her on Friday, she literally dragged her out of a dogs mouth.\\xa0  I: Oh my goodness.  P: Yeah. And he took her home, and then he realized that her legs were broken.\\xa0  I: Broken...  P: And then he put.. he posted a picture on facebook, asking for help, you know, for someone to take it to foster home, or something. And I saw the picture and I said: \"Okay. I\\'ll take it and I\\'ll take it to wet\"...\\xa0wet... Vet!  (both laugh)  I: It\\'s okay. So he.. or she went to the vet?  P: Yeah, and, of course, the vet said.. it would be best to euthanize it, but I\\'m\\xa0absolutely\\xa0against it and I know that she didn\\'t say it because it was really the best solution, but because she just wanted to take money, you know, because that\\'s what kind of doctors and vets we have in Bosnia. So, I asked her, you know, could.. would she be able to live with this defect that she has? And she says: \"Well, yeah, you know, she probably would be able to live but what kind of life would that be for a cat, you know? Not being able to walk, and someone would have to clean up after her all the time, becuase, you know, she can\\'t control her bowel movements and her bladder movements\", so I said: \"It\\'s going to be a great life, don\\'t you worry, thank you so much, goodbye\". And, so, today she went to Zenica, to a friend of mine that I have... Some pictures here... Where is she.. ah, here she is. \\nI: Oh, okay.  P: So, she has fifteen cats at the moment. \\nI: Oh wow.  P: She really loves cats.  I: Yeah!  P: So she\\'s going to take care of her and try to find a her a home in the UK or Germany, because people in Bosnia are\\xa0definitely\\xa0not able to take care of an animal like this. \\nI: Why aren\\'t they able to take care of an animal? \\nP: Well they.. first of all, they don\\'t have much experience and they don\\'t take animals\\xa0seriously, if you\\xa0know what I mean... For example they.. people in here get a cat and they let it out, which is absoloutley unacceptable, you know, because there are stray dogs everywhere and there are cars, and it\\'s really dangerous... I don\\'t know how much do you know about animals, but I know, actually, quite a bit about cats, so I can tell you that. So, we don\\'t want to adopt her in a home like that, we want to... \\nI: Give her a give her a better home.  P: Yes, and in a serious family that will take care of her, for the rest of her life. Maybe they can even get her a, you know, a wheelchair, so she can walk. \\nI: Oh, yeah. \\nP: And she will have a nice life. \\nI: Yeah. So, it sounds like you\\'re very helpful for this cat that has broken legs.\\xa0 \\nP: Yeah. I just, I couldn\\'t leave it. Especially since it\\'s a little kitty, you know.  I: And you went through great lengths to find her the foster home\\xa0temporarily and it sounds like your friends and you will countinue to work until you find her a really good home.\\xa0  P: We will definitely. So I\\'m kind of really sad because, you know.. we have to say goodbye today.  I: Ooh, yeah.  P: But, I don\\'t know, maybe I\\'ll see her again when I return home.  I: Yeah. It\\'s a beautiful cat.  P: Yeah, she\\'s so cute.  I: She\\'s small, she\\'s young.  P: And despite of all that she still wants to play.\\xa0  I: Aw, she still wants to play... (laughs)  P: Yeah.  I: So cute.  P: Around, around on her two legs.\\xa0  (both laugh)  I: Two legs...  P: Poor kitty.  I: Well I\\'m hopeful for the cat that it will be able to walk again. And hopefully, even with assistance, like a wheelchair, you can get to that goal. What about this picutre? Who is this?  P: Oh, this is a friend of mine. I\\'ve known him for about five years, actually he\\'s an ex boyfriend (laughs). Now he\\'s a friend.\\xa0  I: Okay.  P: So he\\'s studying at the Music Academy, in Sarajevo. He\\'s all into music, he sings, his voice is amazing, you know, he plays the guitar, the piano, violin.. everything.\\xa0  I: Wow. So very talented.\\xa0  P: Yeah, he is. But... Okay, so I wanted to talk actually about this picture and maybe this one.  I: I love this picture, it\\'s beautiful.  P: Okay, so these two together maybe.  I: Okay.  P: So, yeah, like I said.. he loves music and he loves classical, but in Bosnia nobody really appreciates that.\\xa0  I: Why don\\'t they appreciate classical music?  P: They\\'re just not on that level, should I say...  I: Okay. I think classical music is beautiful.  P: Yeah. I actually went to high musical school, where we just learned about music. So, I played.. I still play violin, and piano, and guitar.\\xa0  I: Oh wow.  P: But guitar more like a hobby.  I: You\\'re very talented. There is so many pieces of you that I\\'m learning about, I love it.  P: Thank you. But, then I just realized.. it\\'s not my thing to practice, about twelve hours a day for the rest of my life. So I said: \"No. I prefer something else\".\\xa0  (both laugh)  P: So, yeah, this is a piano in my high school and you see how broken it is..? Which is really sad.\\xa0  I: Oh, yes I do.  P: And it\\'\\'s just standing there like that. Yeah.. I took this one with the professional camera, becuase they have it in my school, so I asked them to borrow, you know..?  I: Oh yeah. This was a great picture. I looked at that picture and I was like: \"Wow! That\\'s beautiful\".  P: Thank you. Yeah, and this one also, is taken with a professional camera, nevermind (laughs)...  I: So beautiful. \\xa0 P: So yeah.. I think it\\'s really sad how art is so underappreciated here in Bosnia. Nobody really cares, nobody cares about the classical music, or theatres, or movies, paintings.. nothing. They.. the only thing they care about is.. I don\\'t know have you heard about this.. it\\'s called folk music?  I: Aha. Sevdah?  P: No, no, no. That\\'s art, that\\'s great, that\\'s amazing.  I: Oh, okay.  P: But, it\\'s.. it\\'s called actually turbo folk. Turbo folk... And it\\'s all these chicks, should I say, like with really big breasts and really big bottoms.  (both laugh)  P: And they\\'re like dancing and shaking, and they sing terribly, but the lyrics are like, you know: “You\\'re my boyfriend, I love you“, and stuff like that. And everyone is just crazy about that.\\xa0  I: So more of a pop..?  P: No, it\\'s nothing... There is an expression for that. We call it šund.  I: Šund? And what does that mean?  P: It means it sucks.  I: (Laughs) So funny.  P: Yeah, but people love it here, they love it so much.\\xa0  I: But they don\\'t appreciate the classical..?  P: No, and see my friend here..? He\\'s playing every friday in a cafe, on Baščaršija, maybe you can come to hear him play sometime..?  I: Yeah.  P: So, he has to do that, because he knows that if he plays classical and anything like that, he will make no money at all, absolutely. When he plays here he makes some money, you know, because he really needs it. So, it\\'s really sad, you know.. he doesn\\'t want to do this, but he has to, because that\\'s the only way he can make money, with what he knows how to do best - with playing music.  I: And so can you talk to me a little bit more about this piano? There were the broken pieces that you pointed out, but what else do you know about this picture?  P: Well, I just know that it\\'s been in this school for a very long time and I don\\'t even know who broke it, but it\\'s in the basement and nobody is using it, just like dust falling all over it. And nobody wants to fix it, because even if they did fix it, they wouldn\\'t have practically anyone to play on it.  I: Oh wow. Do you think that it\\'s been broken for five years..?  P: I think much longer, maybe even ten years.  I: Ten years, wow.\\xa0  P: Oh man.  I: (Laughs) Do you want to move?  P: Yeah.  I: We can... Yeah. Let me just get to the other side... And I\\'ll leave my\\xa0cappuccino\\xa0cause it\\'s... it\\'s finished. Do you want me to get your drink?\\xa0  P: You can just take...  I: Okay. Just a little migration. So much more quieter (laughs).  P: And comfy.  I: Oh yes. These chairs are really pretty. They\\'re new, yeah?  P: Mhm.  I: Really nice. We got [cant understand you- surrounded all of the sudden?] (laughs). I was like: \"They\\'re not all sitting down, are they?\" Okay, where was that..? You were saying that the piano was broken, for maybe ten years... So this piano has been broken for about ten years, no one cares about it at the school to even fix it. So it just sits there in the basement, not being used. So, you think that people here don\\'t appreciate the arts? \\xa0 P: Exactly, because they.. the school actually asked for money, from the ministry, but they refused to give it. They said: \"We have more important things than fixing a piano\", and it\\'s actually a really great piano, it\\'s really quality piano, but...  I: Yeah.  P: It can\\'t be used in this condition.\\xa0  I: So they\\'re not willing to invest money into the arts in the schools for kids and students...\\xa0  P: And the other thing that is really tragic, that when we used to.. I used to play in orchestra, in my high school and we would have concerts and whenever we played classical.. in this theatre, mostly.. there would be.. I think there is five thousand seats available...  I: Wow.  P: Yeah, but.. there wouldn\\'t be even thirty people.  I: Really? So people don\\'t attend...  P: I said five thous.. I meant five hundred. Five thousand, that\\'s too much (chuckles).  Y: Okay, yeah. Five hundred...  P: But whenever we would play something else, like for example sevdah, the room would be full, you couldn\\'t get seats.  I: So everyone loves sevdah?  P: Yes. Because it\\'s Bosnian, it\\'s traditional, they don\\'t love classical because it\\'s not really traditional.. it\\'s not Bosnian definitely. No composer is from Bosnia.  I: (Laughs) Interesting. So, there has not been any classical composers from Bosnia really?  P: Well, actually there had been a few from the ex-Yugoslavia, but I don\\'t really like.. Vlado Milošević... Milan Kozadić.. I don\\'t know have you heard of them...  I: I think so, a little.  P: Anyway, they were, like modern composers.. not...\\xa0  I: Classical.  P: Classical. But, in Bosnia, I don\\'t think there is.. only Vlado\\xa0Milošević. And Ado Smailović, sorry. I forgot about him. His daughter is actually a violin player. \\xa0 I: Oh she is? \\n P: She\\'s really great. She lives in Nice, France. She plays everywhere, in Europe, in USA... \\nI: What is her name? \\nP: Violeta\\xa0Smailović Huart.  I: How do you spell that? M-I-L...?  P: What, her name?  I: Mhm.  P: Violeta. I\\'ll try... V-I-O-L-E-T-A.  I: Violeta. And her surname?  P: S-M-A-J-L-O-V-I*, and one letter that doesn\\'t exist in english, it\\'s -Ć. It\\'s like a C, with...  *The participant misspells the name as it sounds as if it were spelled that way (the mistake arises from a mispronounciation of the last name)  I: (Laughs) Like a C with the thing on it.  P: Yes.  I: I know that letter.  P: Oh good. So Ć...  I: Yeah, Ć.  P: And her second last name is H-U-R-T-A*.  *The participant seems to have made a spelling mistake, as she properly pronounced the name earlier/above  I: I need to look her up. I\\'m excited to listen to her music. What does.. do you know what theater says? What does it say up here? Do you know?  P: It says Bosansko Narodno Pozorište. So, Bosnian National Theatre.\\xa0  I: Theatre...\\xa0  P: Yeah.  I: Oh. And this is in Sarajevo?  P: No, this is in Zenica.  I: In Zenica.  P: You see how old it is..?  I: Yeah.  P: Falling apart... Again nobody...  I: No one is putting any money into it, but it has potential.  P: Mhm.  I: Do you think that someone will remodel it one day?\\xa0  P: Perhaps one day, but not soon...  I: Not soon..?  P: I know what the sad thing is, that there are so many cafes just growing up, out of nowhere..  I: This one, for example... (laughs)  P: People invest in that, but they can\\'t invest in fixing a national theatre.  I: Yeah.\\xa0  P: That\\' really tragic.  I: Why do you think that is? Why are they investing in cafes and not the music and the arts.  P: Oh well that\\'s obvious, people in here, I don\\'t know if you noticed, but we really like to go out for a coffee...  I: Everyone loves coffee.\\xa0  P: Everyone loves.. and everyone loves to sit in a cafe for about six hours or more...  I: (Laughs)  P: So that\\'s how people make money, you know..? And nobody goes to the theater so fixing it wont make more popular, you know..? Nobody cares about art.  I: So, what do you think the culture here cares about?  P: Well, first of all, I didnt\\' really think we can call anything in here a culture...  I: Okay.  P: So, yeah... I don\\'t know, maybe I\\'m being too hard on Bosnia...  I: No. No, no, no, you\\'re teaching me so much (laughs).  P: I don\\'t want you to get the wrong opinion.. that we\\'re some primitives or something, because we really are not, but.. there is just not enough people to care about the right things, that\\'s it.  I: Oh, okay.  P: So what was you question again?  I: What was my question... How... How do you think people want to invest their money, since they\\'re not investing into arts, just cafes?\\xa0  P: Cafes and private factories and cars...  I: Oh, okay. What kind of private factories?  P: Anything really.  I: Okay. Just anything that would...  P: Yeah, just private, that\\'s the word. They usually employ a lot of people and then the company brokes down and they close it and so many people stay unemployed and that\\'s.. that just goes on and on...\\xa0  I: What do you think the unemployment rate is, here in Bosnia?  P: I don\\'t know exactly. I actually looked it up, but I forgot the number.\\xa0  I: Okay.  P: It\\'s really big, I think it\\'s the second biggest in Europe.  I: Wow. So unemployment is a huge deal here? So to have a job, it\\'s a really good thing, it sounds like...\\xa0  P: Yeah.  \\xa0I: One other question I wanted to ask was, what does does this say?  P: Oh yeah, this is... This is the good side of Bosnia (laughs).  I: Okay. Can you read it in Bosnian?  P: Ovdje možeš dobiti hljeb, svakom kome je potreban, jer nije u mogućnosti da ga plati*.  *Here you can receive bread, anyone who needs it, because they aren\\'t able to pay for it.  I: Okay.  P: So you can get free bread here, everyone who needs it and is not able to pay for it.  I: Wow.  P: So this was attached on a bakery. It\\'s actually been a sort of project that started out about a couple months ago, and it\\'s spreaded, you know, through all the cities in Bosnia. So, in many bakeries you can actually see this sign. So you come inside, you buy a bread and you leave it in a basket and then somebody who needs it, but can\\'t afford it just goes inside and takes it, and you know, it\\'s beautiful. So it\\'s really nice idea.  I: And it sounds like they\\'re not even judged, right? So...  P: No, no. Absolutely not.  I: Wow, that\\'s wonderful. I didin\\'t know that that sign existed, so now I can look for it and see. \\xa0 P: Maybe it\\'s not the same like this one in everywhere, but.. maybe you can ask, when you go to the bakery, if they have that.  I: Yeah. Because I\\'ve definitely been to the bakeries here (laughs). They have really good bread, very goof treats, yeah. I was wondering what that sign was and since it\\'s in red letters I thought: \"Oh no! What if it\\'s screaming at me?\" (laughs). But, it looks like.. and of course I can\\'t read it because it\\'s in Bosnian, but thank you for explaining it to me, because now I know, that this is almost a way of giving back and showing that the community cares. \\xa0 P: Yeah, exactly.  I: Are there other ways that the community shows care? I mean you told me about the fundraising, if someone can\\'t afford treatment for medical needs...  P: Well, I.. yeah, we also make concerts where we collect money for people like that, for example, I used to do it and we played many concerts like that when I was in high school.\\xa0  I: Oh, okay.  P: A lot of people would show up, and some of them, if they wouldn\\'t be able to come they would just buy a ticket, you know..? To give money anyway.\\xa0  I: Yeah.  P: I don\\'t know what else... Yeah, there is a kind of an organization that collects all sorts of things that people don\\'t need anymore, to give them to poor. Like clothes, shoes.. I don\\'t know... Food, sometimes, or cosmetics, or anything like that.  I: Yeah. So it sounds like everyone can be caring here. When they see in need, they try to help fulfill it. You\\'ve definitely given me.. this is my first interview. So, you\\'ve definitely given me a huge framework to think about and definitely given me a lot of insight into what some of these pictures even mean. Was there any other picture that you wanted to talk about?  P: Yeah. These two I think.  I: Oh yes.  P: You\\'ve seen the other ones. Okay, so this is the factory, a steel factory in my hometown, it\\'s called Mital.\\xa0  I: Okay.  P: It used to be, like a really big deal, back in Yugoslavia, when it was built, but then after the war.. after the country separated, then it kind of started going down, should I say..?  I: Okay.  P: Just falling apart, they went out of business, they...  I: Oh, it out of busniess?  P: Yeah, and.. so, see these?  I: Yeah.  P: These are like really poisonous gas.  I: Oh my goodness. What are they doing releasing these poisoning gasses?  P: They\\'re.. this is the thing.. they\\'re not doing anything to stop it. They can\\'t put simple filter on these chimneys to stop the gas. There have been so many protests and demonstrations and people walking, you know, with those posters and signs, you know. \"We want clean air! We want to breathe! We want our kids to have clean air! Don\\'t kill us! We don\\'t want lung cancer!\", and all those signs.\\xa0  I: Right.  P: But it never changed anything and it\\'s still poisoning everyone.  I: Oh my goodness.  P: I don\\'t know if you\\'ve noticed when you\\'ve been to Zenica how unclean the air is...  I: Well, I was only there maybe ten minutes. But the friends that I met at Zenica kept telling me about all the air pollution, but I.. they didn\\'t explain it to me, so thank you for taking this picture and putting it in this, because now I know what they were referring to. They sent me like a link on facebook to stop air pollution, like a protesting...  P: Yeah, but petitions don\\'t really work in Bosnia.  I: Why don\\'t the petitions work?  P: Because nobody cares, you know. You have to send them to some authorities, you know? But I think they.. I think they just tear them apart: \"Who cares about your pettition? I\\'m going to do what I wanted to do anyway\".  I: Wow. So you think that pettitions are not effective here.  P: No, definitely not.  I: It\\'s just kind of, like, the people are doing what they can do...  P: They\\'re sometimes even fake, you know... For example, they give one issue in the petition, then a lot of people sign it, and they change it to another issue. They just change the pettition, you know, so it can be something else. So you practically sign for something you didnt\\' want to sign.  I: Wow, wow.\\xa0  P: That happened when there was this big problem with stray dogs. I don\\'t know have you heard of that?  I: I\\'ve seen many stray dogs here.  P: But.. about half \\xa0a year ago, people were like really sick of that, even the dogs are biting us, they\\'re attacking our children, they\\'re breaking our ties (presumably tires) and our cars and everything, we want them killed, we want them all out and I\\'m completely against that. But there were like two sides; the animal lovers and the animal haters. So, the haters, they created the pettition, that was of course fake...  I: Oh my gosh.  P: And so many people signed it and then they changed it. Yeah, but then, I don\\'t know what happened... Yeah, to those big demonstrations, that just came out of nowhere and then everyone forgot about stray dogs.  I: (Laughs)\\xa0  P: See, these two are...  I: Are those two stray dogs?  P: Yes, near my building in my hometown in Zenica. So, you see they are left in a pile of trash. And.. I feed them, mostly at night, because during the day there is a lot of noise and many people and they\\'re kind of afraid.  I: Yeah.  P: They hide or something.  I: So you go to feed them at night, like after you get home from school?  P: No actually, only when I\\'m home. When I\\'m not home my mom feeds them.  I: Oh, okay.  P: So see, the poor things. And we have no shelter to take them to.  I: Oh, you don\\'t?  P: We don\\'t have anything like that. Either we\\'re going to find them home by ourselves or they\\'re going to be strays forever, they\\'re going to die in the street.  I: And you don\\'t want that to happen?  P: Of course not. But I think, like I said, people have too many of their own problems to care about anything else.\\xa0  I: It sounds like you\\'re very passionate, though, about animals and care-taking for them  P: Yeah, I am. I love animals.\\xa0  I: Yeah.  P: Especially cats. They\\'re such wonderful companions.\\xa0  I: Yes.  P: They don\\'t argue with me, they don\\'t question my intellect.\\xa0  (both laugh)  I: I have a dog. His name is Moscow.\\xa0  P: Okay.  I: Like Russia. I just named him Moscow five years ago when I got him, because he\\'s white and fluffy like snow, he\\'s a maltese. And, so, I understand. I love the little dog, I would have taken him here to Bosnia, but he has to have a puppy passport in order for that to happen, so I didn\\'t.  P: Yeah, my cats have that actually  I: Oh they do? They have passports (laugh)? So you can travel with them? That\\'s wonderful.  P: But I\\'d never do that, cause that\\'s really stressful for them.  I: Yes.\\xa0  P: For dogs it\\'s one thing, but for cats...  I: It\\'s too stressful.  P: Lets just stay in one place, if possible.\\xa0  I: Yeah. Maybe when I come back next time I\\'ll [bring him?], cause it\\'s hard leaving him with at home [when I\\'m?] far away but... So I understand your passion for animals. And they\\'re beautiful, are they labs? Do you think they\\'re labradors?  P: No, they\\'re just some mix. Like many strays here. They do have a nice fur.  I: Yeah, they have wonderful fur, it\\'s beautiful. I guess one of my last questions is; can you tell me about how the community here has tried, I don\\'t know, to maybe reconcile..? Or what type of healing has taken place and memory of all of the bad stuff that has happened? Have you seen any healing or reconciliation, or..?  P: Well I think I\\'ve seen it on some people who.. whenever, should I say, hurt in the beginning, like myself. \\nI: Oh okay. \\nP: So I really don\\'t care if somebody\\'s Muslim or a Serb or anything like that. \\nI: Yes. \\nP: I would just.. if you\\'re a good person I will be your friend and.. I think that people who have suffered really much in the war, who have lost their family, their loved ones, that they just can\\'t recover, and I do understand that, but.. there is no reason for others, who have suffered nothing..  I: Right.  I: To act like the others who actually have lost somebody. But that\\'s the issue, they\\'re.. everyone is acting the same, no matter what.. which year they were born. Actually I know some people who are younger than me, they are so passionate, you know, about “War this, war that!“ You know..? “I hate this, I hate that...“ Like: “What the hell are you talking about? How old are you?“.\\xa0  (both laugh)  I: You weren\\'t even born yet.  P: Yeah.  I: So you\\'ve seen their parents kind of.. influenced their thinking and their feelings towards people different.. than theirselves?\\xa0  P: My parents are actually really close-minded. For example, I was.. like I said I have my new friends, who are Serbs.  I: Yes.  P: And they invited me to Banja Luka, have you heard about that city?  I: [for the life of me I have no idea what that sound is you\\'re making]   P: Banja Luka.  I: Banja Luka, I\\'ve heard of it, I don\\'t know what in context though.  P: It\\'s a city.  I: Okay.  P: So, there is.. it\\'s in Republika Srpska.  I: Yes! I\\'ve heard.  P: And.. it\\'s you know.. full of Serbs, of course, naturally.\\xa0  I: Yeah.  P: So they invited me there, to sleep over, to go out, and something like that. And my parent [went?]: \"Are you out of your mind? You want somebody to kill you there?\", I was like: \"Please. They are my friends, I know them. Nobody is going to kill me\", \"No way and no way!\", and I didn\\'t go and the end.  I: Really? Wow.  P: And the thing is, my friend knew that my parents would say that, and they said: \"Okay, it\\'s okay, we understand. Our parents would probably say the same about Sarajevo.\"\\xa0  I: Oh, really? So the two cities kind of still have a..? And this was recently?  P: Mhm.  I: Wow.\\xa0  P: During the summer actually, last summer.\\xa0  I: Last summer... So they wouldn\\'t let each other go to hang out at the other friend\\'s house..? And so, did you.. how did you resolve this? Did you get to.. you didn\\'t get to go, and so..?  P: But I got to go with my high school because we had a concert there, so I met with them anyway. So I\\'m glad to use this opportunity.\\xa0  I: So you got to go when you\\'re travelling with a group, but not by yourself.\\xa0  P: I\\'m safe with the group.\\xa0  I: Right, a whole group. That\\'s interesting. This past weekend I went to Prijedor to do the [white armband day?] and I met a lady friend, your home town, Zeni-ća?  P: Zenica.  I: Zenica... And she told me, when we were walking, she kind of whispered, and was like: \"I\\'m a Serb. I\\'m very brave to be walking here right now\", and I was just like: \"Woah\". Like, I didn\\'t still.. I didn\\'t know, I didn\\'t realize that kind of this...  P: Yeah. Because in Prijedor many, many Muslims were killed by Serbs, it\\'s like the city where most people... And there are still some Serbs who live there, and there are also Muslims, there is like, I don\\'t know, a forever conflict (laughs).  I: Yeah. Do they live at seperately?  P: Yeah, they do. So, yeah, she\\'s probably right, she\\'s very brave.  I: And I guess my question is; how do you know if someone is a Serb, or a Croat, or a Bosnian? From my perspective I don\\'t know. So when I ask I don\\'t know.  P: So, a person has to tell you, you know...  I: Oh, a person has to tell you. Okay. So you ask and the person has to tell you, and then that\\'s when they make...  P: Or maybe you can see if they\\'re wearing a sign or something...\\xa0  I: Like..?  P: Like a cross, or a moon with a star on the side.\\xa0  I: Oh.  P: That\\'s a Muslim sign, or like, my friend has.. right here...  I: Oh yeah. That picture.. that\\'s absoloutely...\\xa0  P: David star...  I: That picture is absoloutely wonderful. So beautiful.\\xa0  P: Yeah, I actually took this one with my iPad. I used four different cameras probably.  I: (Laughs) That one\\'s just such a great quality photo. I think that I really want to use this one too.. present with. I think that you\\'ve captured so much in it.  P: Oh we\\'ve tried so many times, we couldn\\'t stop laughing.\\xa0  (both laugh)  I: Oh she was...  P: And I\\'m so: \"What\\'s so funny?\", and she\\'s: \"I don\\'t know!\"  I: Oh, it just captured so much to me. I think that was one of the first ones I saw and I was just like: \"This photo is amazing\".  P: She will be glad cause she\\'s also interested in psychology.  I: Oh, she is?  P: She maybe will apply for the Brown University.  I: Oh, yeah.  P: Now, in July I think. Or the Music Academy, she\\'s a [cant understand this], like I was.  I: Well, I think that the arts and psychology... I mean, this is why you probably love psychology so much, it\\'s because it is art, and it is science and it bridges the two together, no matter people tell you that or.. it\\'s not really advertised.  P: Actually, you know, when I started studying psychology I wanted to do Music Therapy.\\xa0  I: Wonderful.  P: But then, I.. I\\'ve seen all those experiments, and...  I: What experiments?\\xa0  P: Well, I mean the ones we read about.\\xa0  I: Oh... (laughs)  P: Yeah, all those researches. And I thought: \"Wow, this is so interesting. I want to do this\", you know? So I\\'m kind of more thinking about being a scientist, you know..?  I: You can do anything you want to.  P: But I don\\'t know...  I: You can do Music Therapy, you can do research alongside anything.. I mean, that\\'s the wonderful thing about psychology.. you get to choose what you want to do. I do therapy, so at home, I do Art Therapy, and I do something called Trauma Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, I don\\'t know if you\\'ve heard of..?  P: I think I have a book about that...  I: It\\'s a newer approach... And then I do.. so I do therapy of kids, but then I supervise other therapists to have their own clients, so I do therapy with therapists. And so.. but then I also do research. So I do [a bit of?] both, but then, what I really love doing is just humanitarian work. So, I love just to do, like, international, like disater [cant understand this], like, when the floods happened I would be, probably the first one to go, but I was like: \"I have to do research so I can gradute!\", but I think that\\'s the wonderful thing about psychology, cause you can do anything, to do. And you can be passionate about all of equally.. well not equally, but... Yeah, this has been a really great interview. You\\'ve opened my mind to so much. I\\'ve gained insight into so much of.. just the culture, the young adult culture in Bosnia. I\\'m really excited to further analize these photos too. I think that I told you, in the class, that I should be back, probably September, if Renko is here in September, which I think he is cause he does guest lectures or something? I would be here to present everything, so... I\\'ll probably make an announcement about it. So that the people that are interested or that participated can come and see what I found. I think it\\'s going to be [cant understand this] and I\\'m excited to put something out there, in Bosnia, to.. in Bosnian too. To contribute to literature, because we talked about.. it\\'s there, but it\\'s not (laughs).. So to put it.. to make it official (laughs). Did you have any questions for me?  P: No.  I: No? Just wanted to read you this debriefing statement. Thank you for participating in my study, your participation was very valuable to me. I appreciate the time you\\'ve devoted to participating. Through this interview you recalled memories that were passed down from \\xa0on generation to the next, you talked to me about high and low points of Bosnia. If you feel that this interview was very uncomfortable and you feel like you need to contact a professional counselor you can contact Renko\\xa0Đapić, as he is a [NDM, PsyD?], and then you can reach him via e-mail or call his office, but if you feel like you\\'re okay and that I didn\\'t hurt you in any way...  P: Yeah, I\\'m fine.  I: If you have any questions or concerns you can always e-mail me. And if you can get that form for me, that would be great. Did you say that you have one more form?\\xa0  P: Yeah.  I: For?  P: For him.  I: Oh, for him, yes. Just so that I can protect your research.  P: Okay.\\xa0  I: Your photographs.  P: Do you have an empty form?  I: Yes, yeah. I can take one out of here. Do you want it in Bosnian or do you want it in English?\\xa0  P: In Bosnian.  I: Okay.  P: I don\\'t think he speaks English so well.  I: And then.. and then Renko.. I mean, not Renko, Marko, he translated all of the forms again and he got them to me last night, so I\\'m gonna e-mail them all to you after Dr. Dže-pek.. is it Džepek or Džeko? Renko Džepek? Is it Džepek? I can\\'t say his name*. Okay. You don\\'t know. After he approves them I can send them all to you. I\\'m gonna go ahead and stop the recording...   *It\\'s Đapić (Juh-pitch)  P: So I take these?  I: Oh, yes. Hvala!   P: Nema na čemu (chuckles).  You\\'re welcome.\\xa0 '"
